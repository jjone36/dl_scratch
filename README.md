# Deep Dive into the Computer Vision World
*: repo for implementing the neural networks from scratch*

## ***1. Paper with Code***

Studying neural networks can be divided into three parts: *The applications*, *the implementations*, and *intuitions behind these architectures*. Thanks to the user-friendly frameworks such Keras, the applications part are open to everyone. But grasping the real intuition behind the model is overlooked sometimes. What’s the researchers’ intention for building a model with such structures? What motivated them to take such an approach? And what can we infer from the outcome?

This repository is an on-going project for studying the state-of-the-art networks. Starting from VGG, the intuitions and implementation of networks will be covered. The networks are mostly focused on the milestones in Computer Vision such as Image Classification, Object Detections, Image Segmentation, Face Detections etc.
